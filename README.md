# MyReads Project
## description
This is a ReactJS project made in compliance as final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to allow students to demonstrate one's grasp on the use of React library based on the provided course by Udacity.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

The main task of this React project are the following:
1.  Display books on the main page based on three categories or shelves. namely, Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read.
2.  Users can move books betwen shelves.
3.  Users can search from the library for book(s) he/she wants to move to the shelves.
4.  Once selected from library it is automatically displayed in the main UI without the need for refresh.

## How to Load the App

To get started developing right away:
* The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: Node.js

* Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app
* Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app `npm install`
* Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with `npm start`
* A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

* To add new books, click on the green + button at the bottom of the page. Enter an author's name or subject. Up to 20 items will be returned.

Note: The backend API is limited to a fixed set of search terms -- see below for valid search options

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
