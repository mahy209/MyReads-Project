# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## How to Load the App

To get started developing right away:
* The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: Node.js

* Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app
* Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app `npm install`
* Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with `npm start`
* A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

## How to Use the App

* To change a book's category or remove a book from the list, click on the green button on the book cover

* To add new books, click on the green + button at the bottom of the page. Enter an author's name or subject. Up to 20 items will be returned.

Note: The backend API is limited to a fixed set of search terms -- see below for valid search options

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
